# META-CCP
META-CCP (Meta-methodology for contextual classification that preserves narrow features) is a R program for digital image classification. The META-CCP allows reducing classification noises, commonly observed in per-pixel classification products obtained by the classification of remote sensing images, without deteriorating the representation of narrow features.
