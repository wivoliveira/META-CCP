Manuscript title: A meta-methodology for contextual classification that preserves narrow features in remote sensing imagery

Description:
	META-CCP (Meta-methodology for contextual classification that preserves narrow features) is a R program for digital image classification. The META-CCP allows reducing classification noises, commonly observed in per-pixel classification products obtained by the classification of remote sensing images, without deteriorating the representation of narrow features. 
	
	We provide an example using a small portion of a Landsat-8/OLI scene, which is set as the default. The user is required to set the directories related to the input data (variable 'base_directory') and the output directory 'working directory'. All input data required for this example are located at the folder "...Research Data\\Data". The output data resulting from this example are located at the folder "...Research Data\\Results\\Recorte_L8_OLI". The code is originally set to perform the classification generating 100 classification models (J), considering 200 samples per class (N) at each iteration of the resampling process. In addition, the contextual classification stage applies the majority filter with moving windows of 3x3 and 7x7 pixels, considering C-factor values that range from 5 to 20, with a step of 5. A synthesis of the results is presented in the file "0Síntese_Resultados.csv". Statistics are computed for all classification products obtained, included those generated by the Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), the conventional majority filter, and the META-CCP.
